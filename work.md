    description: This project studied collaborations of music artists using Spotify's public API. Using statistical network analysis, comaprisons are made between electronic dance music and rap artists. This study statistically tested the presence of hypothesized power law behaviour of degree distributions and investigated influence using Dijkstra's algorithm-based centrality measures. The code and paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/teryakizhang/SpotiNet">here</a>.

    description: This study used knowledge graph construction and statistical network analysis to analyze the formation of knowledge and concepts around climate change by national media. Using ~27K articles from 5 different countries over 30 years, it was found that national media in environmentally progressive countries have a highly uniform formation of knowledge while less progressive countries saw a sporadic formation of knowledge.
