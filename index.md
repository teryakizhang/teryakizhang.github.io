Hi! 
</p>

<p>
I am a data scientist interested in using AI and machine learning to advance climate research. I have worked for 3 years as a data scientist/developer building various data-driven products in the climate finance space, including carbon market platform and climate risk assessment tools. I am currently a PhD Researcher with the Plymouth Marine Laboratory working to model coastal carbon dynamics using AI and complexity science. I have a Master of Science in Social Data Science from the University of Oxford and a Bachelor's in Environmental Studies with a computer science minor from the University of Waterloo.

Outside of work you will find me surfing, snowboarding, hiking, cooking, or discovering new music.

This website is still under construction, you can find some of my work on my Github for now.
