Hi! I am an applied data scientist interested in using computational analytic methods to advance sustainability research. I have analytics experience within the carbon finance and green buildings industry. I have a Bachelor's in Environmental Studies with a computer science minor from the University of Waterloo and a Master of Science in Social Data Science from the University of Oxford.

I am currently based in London, UK, but I grew up in Vancouver and have lived in Shenzhen and Toronto. You will find me surfing, snowboarding, hiking, cooking, or discovering new music outside of work.
