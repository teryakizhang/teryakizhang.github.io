Hi! 
</p>

<p>
I am a data scientist interested in using AI and machine learning for good, especially in climate and sustainability. I have worked for three years as a data scientist/developer building data-driven products in the climate finance space, including carbon market platform and climate risk assessment models. I have a Master of Science in Social Data Science from the University of Oxford and a Bachelor's in Environmental Studies with a computer science minor from the University of Waterloo.

Outside of work you will find me surfing, snowboarding, hiking, cooking, or discovering new music.
